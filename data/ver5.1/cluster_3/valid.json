        "evidence": "As New South Wales, Australia, continued to deal with some of the state's worst-ever bushfires, skies above the state were filled with smoky haze, even in areas far from the biggest blazes. Michael Jardine was at home in Avoca Beach on November 12 when he noticed ash and burned leaves falling from the hazy sky. He told Storyful, \"Historically, where we are in Avoca, there have been no major issues with bushfires.\" Although largely unaffected by the fires, the closest of which was a two-hour drive away, Avoca Beach did close its public school on November 12. Jardine said he believed the debris seen in the video was blowing in from the Gospers Mountain fire, which had reached 35,000 hectares (about 86,500 acres) at that point. As of November 14, the NSW Rural Fire Service reported 61 fires were still burning across New South Wales, 35 of which were yet to be contained. The organization warned of an increased risk on November 15, with eight parts of the state classified as being under very high or severe fire danger. The national death toll from the catastrophic event has risen to four as firefighters battled blazes across two states. Credit: Michael Jardine via Storyful",

In this video, firefighters attending a fire at Turramurra, in northern Sydney, are hit with pink fire retardant being dumped by planes to protect homes from a nearby bushfire. None of the houses were destroyed, however at least 300 homes have been lost elsewhere in the fires, according to reports. Meanwhile, a man's body was found in burned-out bushland near Kempsey in northwest New South Wales shortly before midnight on November 13, police said, bringing the national death toll from the bushfires to four.

A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across \"a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact.\" When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it.

Mother and daughter pair Jessica and Delylah Meeker are both Lake County residents and recorded footage of the fire as it spread while they drove to different locations in separate vehicles. Jessica was on her way home from work around 8:30PM when she recorded the flames as they raged off the side of Highway 29. The Meekers live on a farm nearby, so Jessica was worried about their animals and land. \"I live about 5 miles from where the fire was, so we were concerned it would travel our way and we would need to prepare for evacuation,\" she told Storyful. Slightly earlier in the evening, Delylah Meeker was driving to the hardware store with her boyfriend when they also witnessed the fire grow and spread. \"It got from campfire size to an acre in a couple of minutes, it was a really fast spread,\" Delylah told Storyful. Moments before she began recording, Delylah called the local fire department and they informed her that she was the first call they had received about the incident, but that they would be sure to act quickly. The fire ended up burning through 25 acres of land and was completely contained as of 11:40AM on October 18, according to Cal Fire. Credit: Jessica and Delylah Meeker via Storyful",

But after footage of Shelby's now-regular gesture of kindness toward 88-year-old Opal Zucca was posted online on October 15, the driver for Waste Management has become an online hero. Zucca's daughter Colette Kingston shared the video of Shelby guiding her mother back up the driveway of Zucca's Independence, Missouri, home on Facebook. After returning Zucca's trash can to its spot beside the house, Shelby gives her a hug and jovially compliments her hair. \"God bless you, as always, darling,\" Shelby says in the video. In the post, Kingston detailed the story behind it. \"In January, my mom fell while trying to bring the trash can back up her driveway and got hurt. This gentleman from Waste Management was there when it happened,\" she wrote. \"Ever since, he has brought the can back up the driveway for mom. This was him today helping her; he demonstrates such care for her. It takes a village,\" she said, adding that the \"small kind gesture\" serves as an \"enormous relief for us.\" Kingston rounded off the note with, \"Thank you kind sir. Love, the Zucca family.\" Shelby soon had local media requesting interviews, and he told Fox 4 News that he \"made a point of making sure\" that Zucca's incident in January would not be repeated.

Property owner Kerry Swain told Storyful the ewes and lambs had been moving to the small green patch of grass at 6am every morning for a feed. \"This is the only green section on our property as it is where the drain runs out to the paddock,\" she said. \"Every morning I hear the little lambs baaing and bleating away. They are very happy to be on the green grass. It's a nice sound in a time of drought.\" Mrs Swain told Storyful her property, 'Oralla', had been in the family since 1852 and had never experienced issues with a lack of water until now. The Bureau of Meteorology has recorded rainfall deficiencies in New South Wales and southern Queensland over the past 17 months, with several areas experiencing their lowest-ever rainfalls. New South Wales is experiencing near-total drought conditions, while around two-thirds of Queensland is in drought. \"My son is a sixth-generation farmer. Our family has never seen it like this. We haven't had water in local creeks or on our property for 18 months,\" Swain said. \"But seeing and hearing these lambs each morning is a nice way to wake up.\" Credit: Kerry Swain via Storyful",
