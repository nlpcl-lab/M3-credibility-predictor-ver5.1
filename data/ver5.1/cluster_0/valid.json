Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into \"Final Jeopardy!\" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category \"Old Testament Book.\" The clue was, \"By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant.\" Emma correctly answered, \"What is Jeremiah?\" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb.

Koalas In Care Inc is a non-profit organisation and registered charity run by Christeen and Paul McLeod. 'Sootie' is one of 26 koalas   both adult and juvenile animals   currently being treated in a makeshift burns unit at the home in Taree. In a Facebook post on November 10, the charity posted a video of Sootie and wrote, \"Adult male has been in a very hot area. 4 paws burnt, fur scorched, nose burnt, ears scorched. In shock and being treated for injuries.\" The following day, the charity posted a second video showing the koala eating leaves. \"Lovely to see him wanting to eat, at this stage. Long way to go, but encouraging signs,\" Sootie's carer is heard saying. Paul McLeod told Storyful, \"We are in overload at the moment. The fire situation is far from over and our township of Taree is in lockdown with the Rural Fire Service taking emergency control. \"We would normally have a network of contacts who would get these animals to us but conditions are too dangerous at the moment, so we are relying on the public to notify us of animals in need. \"We have been running for 27 years and get no government funding. We rely on public donations and our own fundraising to provide the necessary treatment and medications for our koala patients.\" New South Wales battled \"catastrophic\" fire conditions on November 12 with a state of emergency declared for large portions of the east coast. There were 55 fires burning across the state with half yet to be contained and nine burning at a 'watch and act' level. Credit: Koalas In Care via Storyful",

Dave had come over for a visit that day, bringing Gus' favorite treat, an entire loaf of bread. Gus had devoured the loaf in under a minute and now he was a happy bull, except of the itch in his ear. Dave watched Gus trying his best to scratch that itch. In fact, the entire herd was gathered around Gus and they watched him as well. Eventually, Dave thought it best to lend a hand. Gus could use a little help from somebody with fingers and thumbs who could do a better job. Not all bulls would allow this, and not all bulls would even permit somebody to get so close to his females, but Gus is as relaxed as a bull can be. Dave walked up and started rubbing Gus' massive ear. Gus obviously appreciated the assistance and he moved his head to make things easier. He let out a few \"moos\" of contentment and then he wandered away. As Gus takes a few steps away from the brushes, we get a great look at his massive shoulders and rippling muscles. He weighs as much as ten very solid, grown men. Maybe it's because Gus isn't threatened by anything, or maybe it's sheer luck that he's so relaxed, but he doesn't ever react with aggression or hostility. Of course, trying to scratch the ear of a grown bull, or even getting this close to one, is not always wise. Gus is definitely an exception and, even at that, his massive size and strength make him an animal to be respected.",

        "evidence": "Only on a show like The Masked Singer could Triumph the Insult Comic Dog's guest-judging appearance be the least surreal thing that occurs during the episode. Sure, Triumph got in a few of his classic zingers, like when he described the razzle-dazzling Tree as \"the last thing Elton John sees before the Ambien kicks in,\" or   my personal favorite!   when he read regular judge Robin Thicke for filth by saying, \"Dogs and foxes are natural-born enemies, much like Robin and any woman born before the year 2000.\" And Triumph even shared a semi-sweet bonding moment with the Rottweiler, whom he claimed was his illegitimate pup. But the trash-trashing puppet still somehow seemed like a normal, calming, voice-of-reason presence on this totally bonkers program. So, Wednesday brought us another awesome Masked Singer episode   and I don't mean for me to poop on! But it wasn't so triumphant for the Ladybug, who was ultimately sent home. Her rendition of Five Seconds of Summer's \"Youngblood\" was \"spot-on,\" according to pun enthusiast Triumph, but as Season 2 nears its semifinals, she could no longer keep up with the remaining clearly professional singers who competed this week. Still, Kelly \"The Ladybug\" Osbourne does hail from rock royalty, and she did her dad Ozzy proud during her brief Masked Singer run. And Kelly quite possibly was the contestant who had the most fun this season   so she for sure won at life. Dropping her faux Southern accent of the past few weeks, the unmasked reality star/TV host confessed Wednesday in her giggly, famously foul-mouthed British brogue that she'd nearly \"s*** herself laughing\" every week on The Masked Singer   a comment to which Triumph seemed to relate.",

Wouldn't this be an awesome antitheft deterrent sitting in front of your house?\" Hoglin told Storyful that he and his team had been called to remove the bees from the garden decoration by its 75-year-old owner, who happened to be \"highly allergic to bee stings.\" The statue meant a great deal to its owner because it was a gift from her late grandson, Hoglin said.

In fact, we're rather excited to showcase what the future might hold for BMW should this current fascination with fantastically large grilles be allowed to continue unchecked. Perhaps this in-your-face display of kidneys gone wild will at least encourage designers in Munich to think twice before traveling further down this road. Us Motor1.com scribes work very hard to keep a neutral tone, but frankly, we're a bit worried about BMW. This big-grille fad is as ridiculous as the pet rock only without the cool hipster factor. It's as off-putting as listening to glam rock on a scratched-up record. We blame Lexus for this, and while some brands have pulled off the gaping grille with admirable results   we're looking at you, Audi RS6 Avant   oversized kidneys basically turn every BMW into a beaver joke waiting to happen. That's not a good thing. Bigger Isn't Better: BMW Concept 4 Debuts With Massive Double Kidney Grille Reviled BMW Concept 4 Grille Redesigned By Another Fan We aren't alone on this. Peruse the comments of any Motor1.com articles referencing this bonkers nose and you'll find plenty of criticism. Rendering artists the world over have attempted to make the big grille look better, while others   including the anonymous designer who graciously sent us the designs featured above   are ready to show us a world where every BMW is, in a word, ugly. And yes, with BMW's deep involvement in the Toyota Supra, we couldn't resist leading with a makeover that could well come to the Supra's convertible twin, the Z4. Sure, the facelift could've been on an actual Z4, but seeing the double kidney on a Supra has a bit more shock factor. Jump into the slideshow at the top of this article to see just how deep   and how big   this kidney-shaped rabbit hole can grow.",

Mother and daughter pair Jessica and Delylah Meeker are both Lake County residents and recorded footage of the fire as it spread while they drove to different locations in separate vehicles. Jessica was on her way home from work around 8:30PM when she recorded the flames as they raged off the side of Highway 29. The Meekers live on a farm nearby, so Jessica was worried about their animals and land. \"I live about 5 miles from where the fire was, so we were concerned it would travel our way and we would need to prepare for evacuation,\" she told Storyful. Slightly earlier in the evening, Delylah Meeker was driving to the hardware store with her boyfriend when they also witnessed the fire grow and spread. \"It got from campfire size to an acre in a couple of minutes, it was a really fast spread,\" Delylah told Storyful. Moments before she began recording, Delylah called the local fire department and they informed her that she was the first call they had received about the incident, but that they would be sure to act quickly. The fire ended up burning through 25 acres of land and was completely contained as of 11:40AM on October 18, according to Cal Fire. Credit: Jessica and Delylah Meeker via Storyful",

David Spade dressed up as a \"crackhead Hollywood Boulevard Spider-Man,\" on his talk show Lights Out With David Spade. However, the best costumes of the night took place on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where the whole crew dressed as orange circus peanuts. \"If you're watching at home wondering why a giant orange peanut is talking to you, you smoked too much weed and should go to the hospital right away,\" joked Kimmel. So, exactly why did they dress up as circus peanuts? \"I have no idea. I don't remember. But I think we decided this in June and it seemed like a good idea. I think I said I wanted to be the same color as the president's face, and this is what happened,\" Kimmel explained. Kimmel also hosted a Halloween pageant, which featured costumes with a play on puns like Smokey the Chair, JoeKermit, Zolaf, Karate Kidney Bean, Alf on a Shelf, Count Spatula, Guacamol-E.T. and, finally, former basketball star Metta World Peace stepped out as Feta World Peace. It was brilliant. Later in the show, Terminator: Dark Fate star Natalia Reyes came through in an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask that was freakishly real. Finally, Antonio Banderas gave us flashbacks 21 years into the past as he broke out the real Zorro costume from The Mask of Zorro. Which costume from late night television was your favorite?

To the south, the effects of the large bushfires raging in the state of New South Wales were beginning to impact Sydney, as smoke drifted over the city in a prelude to what could be unprecedented fire danger. With temperatures in Sydney forecast to reach around 95 to 100 F (the mid to high 30s Celsius) and winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kilometers per hour) on Tuesday, a New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald \"this is as bad as it gets,\" warning embers could travel up to 19 miles (30 kilometers). At least 64 bush and grass fires were burning across New South Wales, 40 of which had not been contained, on November 11, the RFS said. At least 10 fires were burning out of control at \"Watch and Act\" level. Three people had died by November 11, fire services said, and more than 150 homes had been lost. The RFS predicted \"catastrophic fire danger\" for Greater Sydney on November 12. Similar warnings were in place for the Illawarra, Shoalhaven, and Hunter regions. More than 200 schools were expected to close as a result of the fire threat, NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said. Here, the Ingleside Rural Fire Brigade said its personnel would be on standby for the expected fire danger on Tuesday, November 12. Credit: Ingleside Rural Fire Brigade via Storyful",
