Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into \"Final Jeopardy!\" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category \"Old Testament Book.\" The clue was, \"By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant.\" Emma correctly answered, \"What is Jeremiah?\" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts.",

And it was a double-header, to use some baseball terminology, because Fox made up for lost time by airing two episodes back-to-back. Of course, double the fun meant double the eliminations, so this week we had to bid farewell to two furry friends: the Penguin, aka comedian Sherri Shepherd, and the Black Widow, aka former child star Raven-Symone. Jenny McCarthy had guessed that pretty much every female contestant since Season1 was Shepherd, so she was destined to be correct eventually. As for the Black Widow, I got that one right. I knew that eight-legged diva was so Raven from the very beginning. Anyway, while I have missed The Masked Singer like a Rottweiler misses his bone, a flower misses the sun, or a black widow misses her web, on the plus side, the past two weeks have given me some time off to reflect, furiously pore over various Google search queries and Wikipedia pages, and change my uneducated guesses since the last time many of these kooky cosplay characters rocked the mic.

But after footage of Shelby's now-regular gesture of kindness toward 88-year-old Opal Zucca was posted online on October 15, the driver for Waste Management has become an online hero. Zucca's daughter Colette Kingston shared the video of Shelby guiding her mother back up the driveway of Zucca's Independence, Missouri, home on Facebook. After returning Zucca's trash can to its spot beside the house, Shelby gives her a hug and jovially compliments her hair. \"God bless you, as always, darling,\" Shelby says in the video. In the post, Kingston detailed the story behind it. \"In January, my mom fell while trying to bring the trash can back up her driveway and got hurt. This gentleman from Waste Management was there when it happened,\" she wrote. \"Ever since, he has brought the can back up the driveway for mom. This was him today helping her; he demonstrates such care for her. It takes a village,\" she said, adding that the \"small kind gesture\" serves as an \"enormous relief for us.\" Kingston rounded off the note with, \"Thank you kind sir. Love, the Zucca family.\" Shelby soon had local media requesting interviews, and he told Fox 4 News that he \"made a point of making sure\" that Zucca's incident in January would not be repeated.

To the south, the effects of the large bushfires raging in the state of New South Wales were beginning to impact Sydney, as smoke drifted over the city in a prelude to what could be unprecedented fire danger. With temperatures in Sydney forecast to reach around 95 to 100 F (the mid to high 30s Celsius) and winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kilometers per hour) on Tuesday, a New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald \"this is as bad as it gets,\" warning embers could travel up to 19 miles (30 kilometers). At least 64 bush and grass fires were burning across New South Wales, 40 of which had not been contained, on November 11, the RFS said. At least 10 fires were burning out of control at \"Watch and Act\" level. Three people had died by November 11, fire services said, and more than 150 homes had been lost. The RFS predicted \"catastrophic fire danger\" for Greater Sydney on November 12. Similar warnings were in place for the Illawarra, Shoalhaven, and Hunter regions. More than 200 schools were expected to close as a result of the fire threat, NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said.

Arnold joked, \"Pumping iron was the decision-making factor.\" Arnold worked out with Chris and was quite impressed. \"He's a strong guy, there's no two ways about it, and I'm very proud of him,\" said Arnold. \"When I watched him make these moves in the gym, you know, the incline press specifically did it.
