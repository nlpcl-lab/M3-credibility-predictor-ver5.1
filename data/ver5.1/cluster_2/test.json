However, the best costumes of the night took place on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where the whole crew dressed as orange circus peanuts. \"If you're watching at home wondering why a giant orange peanut is talking to you, you smoked too much weed and should go to the hospital right away,\" joked Kimmel. So, exactly why did they dress up as circus peanuts? \"I have no idea. I don't remember. But I think we decided this in June and it seemed like a good idea. I think I said I wanted to be the same color as the president's face, and this is what happened,\" Kimmel explained. Kimmel also hosted a Halloween pageant, which featured costumes with a play on puns like Smokey the Chair, JoeKermit, Zolaf, Karate Kidney Bean, Alf on a Shelf, Count Spatula, Guacamol-E.T. and, finally, former basketball star Metta World Peace stepped out as Feta World Peace. It was brilliant. Later in the show, Terminator: Dark Fate star Natalia Reyes came through in an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask that was freakishly real.
