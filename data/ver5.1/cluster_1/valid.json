The jumbo noticed the grey Toyota approaching on a bend in Nakhon Rathashima, northeastern Thailand, last Tuesday (October 29) afternoon. The large bull stomped over to the vehicle and kneeled on the bonnet before walking behind and laying its huge body across the rear windscreen. Shocked driver Phassakorn Niltarach was left cowering behind the steering wheel while the beast smashed the glass and dented the bodywork and damaged the mirrors. The vehicle eventually managed to move forward after the ordeal, lasting more than a minute. The woman who recorded the video is heard saying \"are you crazy?\" She then adds: ''You should have driven away earlier before the elephant had chance to do that.\" Speaking after, the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ''I was so shocked when the elephant walked to the car and I was even more surprised when the elephant tried to sit on that car. \"It's lucky that the driver managed to get away safely. I want this to be an example because people should stay well away from the elephants. They might appear friendly but they could hurt you.\" Wildlife rangers in the Khao Yai National Park said that the elephant was a 35-year-old male named Deu. They warned drivers to take extra care when driving through the mountain roads, where elephants often roam. Park ranger Kanchit Sarinpawan said that elephants often venture out of the forest around October when the country's monsoon rainy season ends and the dry and cool period begins. The official reassured motorists that the elephant's behaviour was ''just his way of greeting tourists.\"",

According to Accuweather, the winds in the tornado reached \"between 113 and 157 mph.\" Diaz posted footage of the moment he was filming a \"dusty EF-2 tornado at close range\" as the hailstones almost hit \"the camera from behind,\" to Twitter on October 17. The lucky storm chaser told Storyful the footage was recorded on May 5. No injuries were reported as a result of the storm. However, the cyclone ripped through agricultural areas, \"causing structural damage to farms and wrecking equipment, power lines, and irrigation systems,\" according to media reports. Diaz may be better served in the future by heeding the advice of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). According to NOAA, \"if you are unable to make it to a safe shelter, either get down in your car and cover your head, or abandon your car and seek shelter in a low lying area such as a ditch or ravine.\" Credit: Marcus Diaz via Storyful",

McNabb recorded the video, which shows some of the waterfall spraying back up onto the cliffs, as the winds seem to push the water against its natural trajectory. Backwards flowing waterfalls may be interesting but they are known to exist when particularly strong winds are present. Although the weather was not all sunshines and rainbows, McNabb got to experience a rare phenomenon in a beautiful setting, which made for a scenic hike with friends.

Out-of-control fires were threatening homes near Kempsey, Tenterfield, Hillville, Nowendoc and Armidale, while two emergency-level blazes were impacting the Clarence Valley. Residents in some of the affected areas were told it was \"too late to leave\" and to protect themselves \"from the heat of the fire\" while others were ordered to evacuate immediately. Strong winds were preventing some waterbombers from reaching fires, New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Hot, windy and dry conditions sparked a significant increase in dangerous fire activity across the state's east coast since Friday, November 8. Three people had died and a number were missing while hundreds of properties were damaged as a result of the fires, authorities said. This footage shows smoke from the Hillville fire blanketing a road surrounded by scorched bushland in Rainbow Flat, near Taree, on November 11. Credit: @maroubra65 via Storyful",

Arnold joked, \"Pumping iron was the decision-making factor.\" Arnold worked out with Chris and was quite impressed. \"He's a strong guy, there's no two ways about it, and I'm very proud of him,\" said Arnold. \"When I watched him make these moves in the gym, you know, the incline press specifically did it.
